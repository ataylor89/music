Shostakovich | Symphony 5 | Leonard Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic Orchestra  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FF4HyB77hQ

I'd like to add some notes about Shostakovich's 5th symphony:
- I really discovered this symphony in 2024 or 2025
- I enjoy every movement and I often skip to movement 3 or movement 4, because I'm such a big fan of movements 3 and 4
- Movement number 3 has a really interesting mood
- Movement number 4 has a really interesting mood as well... it's very different from the third movement
- Movement number 4 has some climaxes that I really like
- I used to listen to Shostakovich's 5th symphony before work, at like 8am or 8:30am, to get ready for the day
- I've been a big fan of Shostakovich since the age of 24 or 25

Bach | Toccata and Fugue in D minor  
I often listen to versions on Apple Music, like the one by Academy of St. Christopher Orchestra

Some notes on Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor:
- My family and I often call it TAF
- It's one of my favorite pieces by Bach
- I really love this piece, and I feel a lot when I listen to it... it's very powerful
- Bach is known for his work in counterpoint
- What is counterpoint? I think it's when two (or more) melodies are playing at the same time
- The second, third, fourth, etc melodies are the counterpoint to the first
- The Toccata and Fugue in D minor is a good example of counterpoint
